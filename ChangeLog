2006-11-27  Nigel Tao  <nigeltao@gnome.org>  revision 10

  * Super-Shift-Control-Insert now moves *all* windows from this workspace
    to a new workspace, so as to be consistent with Shift=Move, Control=
    Move-All-Windows-in-this-Workspace and Insert=New-Workspace.


2006-11-27  Nigel Tao  <nigeltao@gnome.org>  revision 9

  * Now does window-frame geometry calculations "the right way", via a
    window's _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS X property, rather than presuming that its
    frame is the same as its parent X window.


2006-11-03  Nigel Tao  <nigeltao@gnome.org>  revision 8

  * One more svn:ignore'd file.
  * Now warps the pointer to the activated window's center, under
    focus-follows-mouse in metacity.  This fixes the behavior where window
    activation would be 'stolen' by whatever window was under where the
    pointer was at the time.


2006-11-03  Nigel Tao  <nigeltao@gnome.org>  revision 7

  * Forgot to svn remove the file 'missing'.

    refresh.

--------------------  2006-04-17  Version 0.3 released  --------------------

2006-04-17  Nigel Tao  <nigel.tao@myrealbox.com>

  * Can drag and drop windows between workspaces.

  * Shift-click and Shift-Control-click on a workspace's icon now works
    the same as Shift-Left/Right and Shift-Control-Left/Right (i.e., it
    moves one or all windows to a new workspace).

  * New tooltips show the window's full title.

  * Basic Xinerama support.  Super-Super (yes, hit both buttons) to
    move a window from one screen to the next.

  * Minor cosmetic changes.

  * Dependencies relaxed to gtk 2.6 and GNOME 2.10.



--------------------  2006-01-22  Version 0.2 released  --------------------

2006-01-22  Nigel Tao  <nigel.tao@myrealbox.com>

  * Fixed crasher when opening "atypical" windows, such as clicking on the
    clock applet.
  
  * Active window is now highlighted a la menu items, rather than a plain
    ol' box.
  
  * Windows needing attention are in bold (consistent with the window list
    and window selector applets), and minimized windows are in italic.
  
  * Mouse scrolls now switch windows (and workspaces, if the mouse is over
    the mini-workspace column-header).
  
  * Super-Tab and Super-Enter now work when there is no window selected.



--------------------  2006-01-01  Version 0.1 released  --------------------

2006-01-01  Nigel Tao  <nigel.tao@myrealbox.com>
