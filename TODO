Known Bugs:

Zarro.

------------------------------------

Deal with pinned (aka sticky) windows.

------------------------------------

Drag-and-Drop...
  ... to re-order workspaces (?) - this might need libwnck support (?), or we
could just fake it like we do with "deleting" a specific workspace.

  ... whilst DnD'ing an arbitrary object, can you start a drag, hit Super to
switch to another window/workspace (after a one-second timeout, perhaps), and
drop?  I can't seem to get Super to trigger whilst I'm dragging something like a
folder in nautilus - does DnD swallow key events??

------------------------------------

Provide little thumbnails of windows, rather than their mini-icon.  This will
probably be unusably slow without some of the more sexy X server extensions
like Composite and Damage, and possibly also libcm (?) as in
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/metacity-devel-list/2005-December/msg00002.html
