superswitcher for Debian
------------------------

Note running instructions and caveats in README, especially:

  SuperSwitcher is best enjoyed if you automatically start the program
  whenever you log in.  To do this, from System -> Preferences -> Sessions,
  go to the Startup Programs tab and add superswitcher.

This might become automatic in a future version of the package.
